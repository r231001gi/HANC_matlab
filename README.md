# (HANC) A new hybrid active noise control system with input-power-controlled online secondary-path modeling
This repository contains code relative to simulations from paper "A new hybrid active noise control system with input-power-controlled online secondary-path modeling". Two simulations cases code, Case_A and Case_B, are provided. The detail introduction can be found in the paper.
# Getting started
Known dependency: Matlab R2022a
# Code structure
Case_A: Case_WHN_Sys_A.m, Case_WHN_Sys_B.m, Case_WHN_Sys_C.m, Est_SP.mat.

Case_B: Case_B_Sys_A.m, Case_B_Sys_B.m, Case_B_Sys_C.m, Est_SP_COR.mat.
# Notice
In both cases, you should run the programs in order of "xx_Sys_A.m", "xx_Sys_B", and "xx_Sys_C.m".
Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. 
The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
